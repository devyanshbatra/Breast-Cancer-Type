# Breast-Cancer-Type
**Project Description: Breast Cancer Classifier using TensorFlow (Non-CNN)**

Breast cancer is a widespread and serious health concern, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on building a breast cancer classifier using TensorFlow without relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Whether you're a healthcare professional, data scientist, or advocate for early cancer detection, this project offers a unique approach to breast cancer classification using classical machine learning techniques.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Breast Cancer Classification:** The primary objective is to develop a classification model that can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant breast tumors based on various features extracted from medical data.

- **TensorFlow for Non-CNN Models:** This project harnesses the capabilities of TensorFlow for creating and training classical machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines, for breast cancer classification.

- **Interpretability:** The project emphasizes model interpretability, making it easier for medical professionals to understand the basis of model decisions and fostering trust in the technology.

- **Dataset Agnostic:** While a sample dataset may be provided, the project is designed to handle different types of breast cancer datasets, allowing adaptability to diverse sources of medical data.

- **Open Source:** This project is open source, inviting collaboration and contributions from the healthcare and data science communities.

**Key Components:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing techniques are included to clean, normalize, and prepare the medical data for analysis, ensuring its suitability for machine learning.

- **Classification Models:** Various non-CNN machine learning models are implemented and evaluated for their effectiveness in breast cancer classification. These may include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.

- **Feature Engineering:** The project may involve feature engineering to extract relevant information from the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to discriminate between benign and malignant tumors.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis are employed to assess the performance of the classification models.

- **Interpretability Techniques:** Efforts may be made to provide explanations for model predictions, making it easier for healthcare professionals to comprehend and trust the model's decisions.
